      <li>36:00- Abe tries to open the incorrect storage room door. Aaron knows it's the wrong door as he has used the boxes more than Abe.</li>
      <li>43:32- Aaron's wife asks him if he called pest control to investigate the 'rats' in the attic. Aaron says they are birds but it is really his double that he hid in there on a previous timeline.</li>
      <li>46:32- In the Library Abe notices that Aaron is writing very slowly and carefully to make it look neat. This is a side effect of using the box to travel back in time. Abe at this point doesn't know that Aaron has traveled in time more than he has.</li>
      <li>47:55- Aaron's ear bleeding. Another side effect of time travel.</li>
      <li>1:04:20- Abe's ear is now bleeding.</li>
      <li>1:09:18- Aaron talks about the party. He reveals he didn't attend the party in timeline 2, but he did in timeline 9 when he initially disarmed the gunman.</li>
