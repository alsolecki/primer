This allowed him to play the recording back with a 3 second offset so he could repeat the exact same words he used in the previous timelines. This would allow him to try and re-live the previous 4 days withough anything changing. Abe 2 watches as Aaron 3 talks to Abe's girfriends ex-boyfriend's cousin, and invites him to Robert's party. The pair go to Aaron's garage and discuss a plan to de-fuse the future event of Rachel's ex-boyfriend threatening her with a shotgun at the upcoming party. Abe 2 is unsure, but Aaron 3 eventually persuades him.`}

Aaron 2 suggests that it may have been taken them three, hour or maybe even twenty attempts. The answer is unknown, so from here they create timeline 11 and possibly another number of additional timelines. When they eventually get it right, they create a timeline with an unknown number (the final timeline seen in the film).`}
