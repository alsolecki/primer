      <li>Drugged Abe and Aaron are shown as short markers on timelines 4 to 11+, but they are present for the duration of the timelines they are on.</li>
      <li>Most of the film is presented in a linear fashion, which appears to be timeline 9. Although the final event of timeline 3 happens before timeline 9, it is not revealed until timeline 10.</li>
      <li>At the end of the film, there are 2 x Abes and 3 x Aarons living permanently on the same timeline.</li>
